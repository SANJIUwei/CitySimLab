# Codex Handoff

This document is written for Codex, not for human-facing tutorial prose. Update it at the end of every work/home session before committing and pushing.

## Sync State

- Last updated: 2026-08-31
- Last known location: work
- Git branch: main
- GitHub remote: not configured
- GitHub auth: GitHub CLI installed, not logged in on the work machine
- Environment root: `E:\Myself\CitySimLab`

## Project Intent

The user wants to learn by building the project themselves. Codex should provide scaffolding, debugging, verification, and learning guidance. Do not prebuild city simulation gameplay systems unless the user explicitly asks.

## Current Repository State

- Solution exists: `CitySimLab.slnx`
- Core library exists: `src/CitySim.Core`
- Headless runner exists: `src/CitySim.Headless`
- Unity mock helper library exists: `src/CitySim.UnityMock`
- Test project exists: `tests/CitySim.Tests`
- Documentation folder exists: `docs`
- Save folder placeholder exists: `saves/.gitkeep`

## Latest Completed Work

- Created the C# solution and project skeleton under `E:\Myself\CitySimLab`.
- Added a minimal smoke test so `dotnet test` confirms project references are wired.
- Added a minimal headless runner that prints environment readiness only.
- Added learning docs without implementing gameplay mechanics.
- Removed earlier over-scoped gameplay prototype files after the user clarified that gameplay should remain their work.

## Verification Log

- `dotnet build --no-restore`: passed on 2026-08-31.
- `dotnet test --no-build`: passed on 2026-08-31, 1 test.
- `dotnet run --project src\CitySim.Headless`: passed on 2026-08-31.

## Open Blockers

- GitHub remote is not configured.
- GitHub CLI is installed but not authenticated.
- Need the user to either log in with `gh auth login` or provide a GitHub repository URL/token flow they prefer.

## Next Recommended Codex Action

If the user asks to finish GitHub sync:

1. Confirm whether to create a new GitHub repo or connect an existing one.
2. Configure `origin`.
3. Push `main`.
4. Re-run clone/pull instructions mentally for a second machine.
5. Update this handoff with the remote URL and latest commit hash.

If the user asks for gameplay learning:

1. Ask them to choose one tiny first object: coordinate, tile, or tick.
2. Let them attempt the code first.
3. Help them write the smallest useful test.
4. Keep implementation scope deliberately small.

## Files Codex Should Read First
